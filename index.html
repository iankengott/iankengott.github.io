        <h2>Relativity</h2>
        <p><strong>Relativity</strong> refers to two theories developed by Albert Einstein: Special Relativity and General Relativity. Both fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, and gravity.</p>
        
        <h3>Special Relativity (1905)</h3>
        <p>This theory deals with objects moving at constant speeds, especially speeds close to the speed of light. Its two main postulates are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to each other.</li>
            <li>The speed of light in a vacuum is constant and independent of the motion of light sources or observers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Key concepts include time dilation (moving clocks run slower) and length contraction (moving objects are shorter along the direction of motion).</p>
        
        <h3>General Relativity (1915)</h3>
        <p>This theory extends the principle of relativity to include acceleration and gravity. It describes gravity not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Massive objects like planets and stars warp the spacetime around them, and this curvature affects the motion of other objects.</p>
        <p>General Relativity has been confirmed by various experiments and observations, including the bending of light by gravity and the precise movements of planets.</p>
        
        <p>Both theories have profound implications for our understanding of the universe and have been experimentally verified in many ways.</p>
